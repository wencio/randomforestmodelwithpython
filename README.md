Random Forest classifier model 
Here's a step-by-step description of the code:

Import necessary libraries, including NumPy, Pandas, and Scikit-Learn modules.

Load the Iris dataset using load_iris() from Scikit-Learn's datasets module. This dataset is used for classification and contains features and target labels.

Split the dataset into training and testing sets using train_test_split(). This is done to evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.

Create a Random Forest classifier model with 100 decision trees (n_estimators=100) and a fixed random state for reproducibility.

Train the Random Forest model on the training data using fit().

Use the trained model to make predictions on the test set with predict().

Calculate the accuracy of the model's predictions by comparing them to the actual target values using accuracy_score().

Print the model's accuracy to evaluate its performance on the test data.
